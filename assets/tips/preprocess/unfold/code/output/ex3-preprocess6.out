sparse(A)
```

Convert an AbstractMatrix `A` into a sparse matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Matrix(1.0I, 3, 3)
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  1.0

julia> sparse(A)
3×3 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1.0   ⋅    ⋅
  ⋅   1.0   ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅   1.0
```

```
sparse(I, J, V,[ m, n, combine])
```

Create a sparse matrix `S` of dimensions `m x n` such that `S[I[k], J[k]] = V[k]`. The `combine` function is used to combine duplicates. If `m` and `n` are not specified, they are set to `maximum(I)` and `maximum(J)` respectively. If the `combine` function is not supplied, `combine` defaults to `+` unless the elements of `V` are Booleans in which case `combine` defaults to `|`. All elements of `I` must satisfy `1 <= I[k] <= m`, and all elements of `J` must satisfy `1 <= J[k] <= n`. Numerical zeros in (`I`, `J`, `V`) are retained as structural nonzeros; to drop numerical zeros, use [`dropzeros!`](@ref).

For additional documentation and an expert driver, see `SparseArrays.sparse!`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Is = [1; 2; 3];

julia> Js = [1; 2; 3];

julia> Vs = [1; 2; 3];

julia> sparse(Is, Js, Vs)
3×3 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  2  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  3
```
