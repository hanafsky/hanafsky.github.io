`HTML(s)`: Create an object that renders `s` as html.

```
HTML("<div>foo</div>")
```

You can also use a stream for large amounts of data:

```
HTML() do io
  println(io, "<div>foo</div>")
end
```

!!! warning
    `HTML` is currently exported to maintain backwards-compatibility, but is considered to be deprecated and should not be used.
